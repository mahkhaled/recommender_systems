## Non Personalized

Non personalized doesn't care who was the user

Non personalized uses some formula like average

Average lack context (the situation when a user rated a model)

Correlation:

X+Y
---
 X

There is a problem with correlated products because actually most people are buying bannana, so does that mean if I bough a mac pro, will you recommend a bannana for me?

Other solutions
P(X AND Y)
----------
P(X) * P(Y)

Cons:
Non directional association

## Rating

Explicit preferences (ask user about his opinion) ex: rating, thumbs, likes, review, vote

Implicit preferences (their actions say a lot!) ex: click, purchase, follow
More examples of implicit:
* how long did user read?
* skipped a video, so don't recommend again in the next short period
